//QUESTION :
/*Use arrays to create a queue. The queue is assumed to be full before performing
the reverse operations. Write a program to reverse the contents of queue
according to its Size N.

1. If N is even, reverse it in group of N/2 nodes and store the contents in a
doubly linked list.
2. If N is odd, keep the middle node as it is, reverse first N/2 elements and
reverse last N/2 elements and store it another doubly linked list

Examples:
Input : 1,2,3,4,5,6 (N is even)
Output : 3<-> 2<->1<->6->5<->4

Input : 1 ,2,3,4,5,6,7 (N is odd)
Output : 3<-> 2<-> 1<->4<->7<->6<->5
Note: Inserting and deleting elements from the queue must be performed only
through the rear and front positions only.
Outputs should be displayed for both the even and odd conditions.*/
